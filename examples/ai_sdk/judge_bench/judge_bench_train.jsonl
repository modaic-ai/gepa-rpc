This means that the ciphertext provides no information about the plaintext. \n\n2. **One-Time Pad**: The One-Time Pad (OTP) is known to achieve perfect secrecy under certain conditions:\n   - The key must be as long as the message.\n   - The key must be truly random.\n   - The key must be used only once.\n\nExamining the options in light of these conditions:\n\n- **(A) Yes, if the PRG is really \u201csecure\u201d**: A pseudo-random generator (PRG) can produce keys that approximate randomness, but true perfect secrecy requires truly random keys, not pseudo-random ones. Thus, a secure PRG alone does not guarantee perfect secrecy.\n\n- **(B) No, because perfect secrecy is not possible in any cipher**: This is incorrect. As mentioned, the One-Time Pad achieves perfect secrecy.\n\n- **(C) Yes, if the stream cipher is implemented correctly**: Implementation alone does not guarantee perfect secrecy without the necessary condition of the key being as long as the message and truly random.\n\n- **(D) No, since the key is shorter than the message**: This is generally true. If the key is shorter than the message and reused, it cannot provide perfect secrecy. However, this is not a statement about all stream ciphers.\n\n- **(E) Yes, every cipher has perfect secrecy**: This is incorrect. Only specific ciphers like OTP can achieve perfect secrecy.\n\n- **(F) Yes, if the key is longer than the message**: This statement is close. Perfect secrecy requires the key to be at least as long as the message, not longer, and that it be truly random and used only once.\n\n- **(G) No, only block ciphers can have perfect secrecy**: This is incorrect. Stream ciphers like the One-Time Pad can have perfect secrecy.\n\n- **(H) Yes, if the key is used only once**: This is a necessary condition, but not sufficient by itself. The key must also be as long as the message and truly random.\n\n- **(I) No, since the key is reused for the stream cipher**: If the key is reused, then perfect secrecy cannot be achieved. This is a true statement, but it does not cover the situation where the key is not reused.\n\n- **(J) No, there are no ciphers with perfect secrecy**: This is false, as the One-Time Pad can provide perfect secrecy.\n\nTaking all the reasoning into account, the best possible answer is:\n\n**(F) Yes, if the key is longer than the message**, acknowledging the auxiliary conditions implied (truly random and used only once).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nFFFFFF", "response_B": "To determine if a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy, we need to review the criteria for perfect secrecy and the properties of stream ciphers and their key usage.\n\n**Perfect Secrecy:** According to Claude Shannon, perfect secrecy means that the ciphertext reveals no information about the plaintext, irrespective of the computational power of the adversary. The only known cipher to achieve perfect secrecy is the one-time pad, which uses a random key that is at least as long as the message and is never reused.\n\nGiven this definition, let's analyze each choice systematically:\n\n(A) Yes, if the PRG is really \u201csecure\u201d\n- A pseudorandom generator (PRG) being secure does not itself guarantee perfect secrecy, since perfect secrecy requires the use of a truly random key that is as long as the message and is never reused.\n\n(B) No, because perfect secrecy is not possible in any cipher\n- This statement is false because a one-time pad provides perfect secrecy.\n\n(C) Yes, if the stream cipher is implemented correctly\n- Correct implementation alone does not ensure perfect secrecy unless it follows the one-time pad principles (key as long as the message and one-time use).\n\n(D) No, since the key is shorter than the message\n- This is an accurate statement for most practical stream ciphers. If the key is shorter than the message, perfect secrecy is not achievable as the same key would be reused, inherently breaking perfect secrecy.\n\n(E) Yes, every cipher has perfect secrecy\n- Incorrect, as most ciphers, including widely used stream ciphers, do not achieve perfect secrecy.\n\n(F) Yes, if the key is longer than the message\n- This is getting closer, as for perfect secrecy, the key must be as long as or longer than the message and not reused.\n\n(G) No, only block ciphers can have perfect secrecy\n- This is false. Perfect secrecy is not limited to block ciphers; the one-time pad is a type of stream cipher.\n\n(H) Yes, if the key is used only once\n- This is not entirely complete; the key must also be at least as long as the message and truly random.\n\n(I) No, since the key is reused for the stream cipher\n- Correct, reusing the key would violate perfect secrecy.\n\n(J) No, there are no ciphers with perfect secrecy\n- This is incorrect as the one-time pad achieves perfect secrecy.\n\nConsidering our step-by-step analysis, the most accurate choice is (D) because it correctly identifies a fundamental requirement for achieving perfect secrecy (key length at least as long as the message and non-reuse).

It would be impossible for services to get a TCP connection to the client web browser.\n    - OKWS design involves okld, the launcher daemon, which starts other components like okd and multiple other services. Typically, incoming TCP connections are accepted by okd and then passed to specific services. Without the ability to pass file descriptors (e.g., TCP socket descriptors) between processes, the services wouldn't be able to receive accepted TCP connections from okd. \n    - However, if a service inherits a listening socket from its parent through fork and exec, as long as the service process is configured to listen to the correct socket, it might still receive connections directly. This would change how OKWS works fundamentally but not make it *impossible* for services to receive connections.\n\n2. It would be impossible for okd to run as a non-root user.\n    - Running as a non-root user is generally about permissions rather than file descriptor passing. OKWS can achieve this by starting okd as root, binding to the necessary ports (which requires root access), and then dropping privileges.

If Unix did not provide a way of passing file descriptors between processes, this handoff mechanism would be disrupted.\n   - However, in the context of Unix, while file descriptor inheritance via fork and exec is still allowed, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that without actual descriptor passing across distinct processes, direct handoff mechanisms would indeed be hindered.\n   - Thus, the statement is true because the lack of descriptor passing would disrupt the ability to manage TCP connections efficiently between different server components.\n\n2. **It would be impossible for okd to run as a non-root user.**\n   - The `okd` process (OKWS daemon) typically requires root privileges initially to bind to well-known ports (below 1024) but can drop privileges to run as a non-root user after binding.\n   - The ability to drop privileges to a non-root user and manage file descriptor inheritance for effective operation does not necessarily depend on passing file descriptors across distinct processes, provided the transition from binding to service is managed through appropriate privilege leveling within the lifecycle of the daemon.\n   - So, this statement is false because the lack of file descriptor passing does not preclude `okd` from accomplishing privilege dropping.\n\nGiven these analyses, the correct answer to the multiple-choice question would be:\n- 1 is True\n- 2 is False\n\nThus, the right choice is:\n(A) True, False\n\nAs requested, the repeated string is:\nAAAAA", "label": "B>A"}

Thus, Ryan lies.\n\nWe can summarize based on these deductions:\n- The person at the library (Ryan) lies.\n- The person at the park (Jaxon) lies.\n- The person at the bookstore (Nia) lies.\n\nThus, our final answers are:\n**no, no, no**", "response_B": "To solve the problem, we need to determine whether each person either tells the truth or lies based on the given statements and their locations.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the key information and positions in a structured way:\n\n- **Nia is at the bookstore.**\n- **Ryan is at the library.**\n- **Emily is at the museum.**\n- **Isabella is at the hotel.**\n- **Olivia is at the beach.**\n- **Jaxon is at the park.**\n- **Nadia is at the farm.**\n- **Grace is at the airport.**\n- **Beatriz is at the school.**\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1.

Generally, for weak bases, the pKb is not necessarily lower than the pH.\n\n(D) Equal to the pOH:\n   - This is highly unlikely as pOH is directly related to the concentration of OH\u207b in the solution, not to the pKb of a base.\n\n(E) Near 0 at 25\u00baC:\n   - This is incorrect because this would imply a very strong base, not a very weak one.\n\n(F) Higher than the pH:\n   - A very weak base having a high pKb could indeed be higher than the pH of the solution.\n\n(G) Near 7 at 25\u00baC:\n   - This would indicate a moderately strong base, but not necessarily a very weak one.\n\n(H) Higher than the pOH:\n   - Given that a very weak base has a very high pKb, it is likely to be higher than pOH.\n\n(I) Equal to the pKa:\n   - This is usually involved in discussions of conjugate acid-base pairs, but doesn't directly answer the question about pKb of a weak base.\n\n(J) Equal to the pH:\n   - pKb is related to the base dissociation constant and not directly equal to pH.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the options pointing towards a condition where pKb is high (A, F, H) are the most relevant.

As he did so, the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth. He immediately spat out the furry object and saw that it was a dead mouse. The buyer suffered severe emotional distress but did not suffer any physical illness or injury. If the buyer asserts a claim against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing, he will most likely\n(A) not recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\n(B) recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\n(C) not recover, because the dairy cannot be proven to have been the source of the mouse.\n(D) recover, under the theory of strict liability.\n(E) recover, because he suffered severe emotional distress.\n(F) recover, because the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to properly package the milk.\n(G) not recover, because the buyer's proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.\n(H) recover, because the dairy failed in its duty of care.\nIf you cannot determine the correct multiple-choice answer, take your best guess.

The buyer found a dead mouse in his milk, causing severe emotional distress but no physical injury.\n\n2. The claim is based on negligent manufacturing against the dairy.\n\n3. The key legal principle to consider here is the \"product liability\" law.\n\n4. In product liability cases, manufacturers can be held strictly liable for defects in their products that cause harm to consumers.\n\n5. Strict liability does not require proving negligence; the presence of the foreign object (mouse) in the product is enough.\n\n6. The fact that the buyer suffered only emotional distress and no physical injury complicates the case, as some jurisdictions require physical injury for recovery in product liability cases.\n\n7. However, the question specifies \"negligent manufacturing,\" which suggests we should focus on negligence rather than strict liability.\n\n8. In a negligence case, the plaintiff would need to prove duty, breach, causation, and damages.\n\n9. The presence of a mouse in a sealed container of milk strongly suggests negligence in the manufacturing process.\n\n10. While emotional distress alone might not be sufficient for recovery in some jurisdictions, the extreme nature of finding a dead mouse in one's mouth could potentially meet the threshold for recovery.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely correct answer is (B) recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. This legal doctrine allows negligence to be inferred from the mere fact that an accident occurred, which fits this situation well.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: BBBBB", "response_B": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The buyer found a dead mouse in his milk, causing severe emotional distress but no physical injury.\n\n2. The claim is against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing.\n\n3. The key issue is whether emotional distress alone, without physical injury, is sufficient for recovery in a negligence case.\n\n4. In most jurisdictions, pure emotional distress without physical injury is not enough to recover damages in a negligence case.\n\n5. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur might apply, but it doesn't overcome the emotional distress limitation.\n\n6. Strict liability might be applicable, but the question specifically mentions a negligence claim.\n\n7. The dairy's duty of care is relevant, but again, it doesn't overcome the emotional distress limitation.\n\n8. The proper cause of action is not intentional infliction of emotional distress, as there's no evidence of intent.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most likely answer is (A): The buyer will not recover because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.\n\nTherefore, my answer is: AAAAA", "label": "B>A"}

Therefore, Quan tells the truth.\n\n2. **Elowen is at the planetarium.** The person at the bookstore says the person at the planetarium tells the truth. Since Ayaan is at the bookstore, it means Ayaan says Elowen tells the truth. This doesn't immediately help us, but keep it in mind.\n\n3. **Soren is at the school.** The person at the school lies. Therefore, Soren always lies.\n\n4. **Devika is at the gym.** The person at the gym lies. Therefore, Devika always lies.\n\n5. **Tala is at the movie theater.** The person at the movie theater lies.

However, many statements come from the zoo:\n  - The person at the zoo says the person at the park lies. Theo is at the park.\n  - The person at the zoo says the person at the bookstore lies.

Emily is at the city hall. So, Emily tells the truth since Quan tells the truth and through Emily's linkage.\n\nTo resolve:\n- Since Max at the library says Luna at the airport lies, and Luna says Ethan at the zoo tells the truth, we need to reconcile both lies and truths cascading through Luna.\n\n  Max says Luna lies -> Luna says Ethan tells the truth. (Luna lies, hence Ethan lies.)\n  Ethan lies about Theo and Ayaan (Ethan lies, Theo tells the truth/Ayaan tells the truth contradictions possible.)\n\nThis chain implies:\n- Quantitative verification:\n  - **Quan (truth), Emily (truth)** hence verified combination\n  - **Luna lies** vs **Liam truth** verified\n  Luna relative overlay of lies on Ethan/Zoo balance remains:\n  **Ethan (Zoo) lies, Charlie vineyard truths/corrections needed.**\n\nFinally, calculated balance:\n  - Bookstore true if Airport offset delegate unverified corrosion consistent Ethan deception outcomes correct.\n\nThus:\n**no, no, yes** for the stepwise validation and derived key resolution consistency.", "response_B": "To go through this step-by-step, I will identify the statements and cross-reference them to determine who tells the truth and who lies.\n\n1.

This means Ethan at the zoo lies about Theo at the park lying, so Theo at the park tells the truth.\n- This also means Ethan at the zoo lies when he says Ayaan at the bookstore lies. Therefore, Ayaan at the bookstore tells the truth.\n- As Ayaan tells the truth, Elowen at the planetarium tells the truth.\n- The library person (Max) lies, so Luna at the airport does not lie. Hence, Luna at the airport tells the truth.\n- Priya at the art gallery lies, contradicting the farm-person (Liam) statement about Luna telling the truth. This should solidify that both Liam at the farm tells the truth.\n\nFrom the above deductions, we confirm:\n1. Luna at the airport tells the truth.\n2. Ethan at the zoo lies.\n3.

The entire cube remains intact.\n\n3. **Effect of the Plane on the Sphere:**\n   - The sphere has a radius of 0.5 (being a unit sphere).\n   - Given the center \\( J \\) is 5 units away from the midpoint \\( K \\), this plane will not intersect the sphere either.\n   - The sphere also remains intact.\n\nConsidering the plane doesn't intersect or cut either the cube or the sphere:\n\n- The cube remains in 1 piece.\n- The sphere remains in 1 piece.\n\nThus, following the cut through point \\( K \\), the number of pieces is:\n\\[ 1 \\text{ (cube)} + 1 \\text{ (sphere)} = \\boldsymbol{2} \\]\n\nUltimately, the number of pieces formed after the cut is:\n\n**2**", "response_B": "To solve the problem of counting the number of pieces obtained after making a cut, we need to go through each step and consider how the cut affects the cube and the sphere.\n\nFirst, let's consider the unit cube:\n- The cube is a solid unit cube, meaning all its sides are of length 1.\n- Vertices A, B, C, D are on the top face of the cube.\n- Vertices E, F, G, H correspondingly sit directly below A, B, C, D on the bottom face.\n- The distance from point A to point J is 10 units, and points A, D, and J are collinear.\n- K is the midpoint of AJ, and thus, it lies 5 units away from A (since the total distance AJ is 10 units).\n\nNow let's consider the unit sphere:\n- The sphere is a solid sphere with a center J.\n- The plane of the cut goes through point K (the midpoint of AJ), and this plane is orthogonal to AJ.\n- Given that the radius of the unit sphere is 0.5, the diameter of the sphere is 1 unit and thus, it is quite smaller compared to the given distance from cube to sphere origin.\n\n### Analyzing the Cuts\n1. **Cut through the Cube**:\n   - Since K is 5 units from A and the entire cube's side length is 1 unit, the cutting plane does not intersect the cube directly. In fact, K resides outside the cube\u2019s dimensions.\n   - Therefore, the plane does not cut through the cube directly and thus the cube remains a single piece.\n\n2. **Cut through the Sphere**:\n   - K is the midpoint of AJ. AJ is 10 units in length, thus J is positioned 10 units away from A and K being midway, 5 units from A and 5 units from J.\n   - As the plane is orthogonal to AJ, it intersects exactly through the center of the sphere.\n   - A plane cut directly through the center of the sphere splits the sphere into 2 hemispheres.\n\n### Conclusion on Pieces Count:\n- Since the cube remains uncut, it is still only 1 piece.\n- The sphere is divided precisely into 2 pieces.\n\nAdding these, the total number of pieces we have is:\n\n- 1 piece from the cube\n- 2 pieces from the sphere\n\nThus, the total number of pieces after the cut is \\( 1 (cube) + 2 (sphere) = 3 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is **3**.", "label": "A>B"}

it is about balancing large business power, not a competitive advantage.\n    - **(E)** Countervailing power is the self-regulation by corporations to prevent government intervention.\n       - This is not `countervailing power'; it's not about self-regulation but external balancing forces.\n    - **(F)** Countervailing power describes the restraints that are placed on giant corporations in the absence of competition.\n       - This seems a strong candidate, as it talks about external restraints balancing corporate power.\n    - **(G)** Countervailing power refers to the international regulations imposed on multinational corporations.\n       - It's broader than just international regulations.\n    - **(H)** Countervailing power is the authority of government to nationalize large corporations.\n       - This is not accurate;

The key issue here is that the state is charging different prices for the same product (crawfish) based on whether the buyer is a resident or non-resident of the state.\n\n2.

The state's justification that the higher fee is a \"reasonable contribution toward the protection they received from the state\" is unlikely to be sufficient to overcome the constitutional concerns.\n\n6. Courts have generally been skeptical of laws that impose higher fees or taxes on out-of-state residents for access to state resources.\n\n7.

We are told that the person at the zoo tells the truth.\n\n2. The person at the amusement park, Ethan, must either tell the truth or lie. The person at the shopping mall, Theo, says that Ethan (Ethan) lies. Since Theo says Ethan lies, if Theo tells the truth, Ethan must lie. If Theo lies, then Ethan tells the truth.\n\n3. The person at the hotel, Tala, says the person at the shopping mall tells the truth. So Theo tells the truth if Tala tells the truth and vice versa. So Tala and Theo must either both tell the truth or both lie.\n\n4. The person at the ice skating rink, Jake, says the person at the hotel (Tala) tells the truth.

For example, if the answer is K, then write KKKKK.\nLet's think step by step.", "response_A": "Sure, let's break this down step by step to understand the impact of gene flow between populations:\n\n1. **Gene flow** is the transfer of genetic material from one population to another. This can happen through various mechanisms like the movement of individuals or the dispersal of gametes (e.g., pollen).\n\n2. The key impact of gene flow is that it tends to **reduce genetic differences** between populations because new alleles introduced by migrants can become part of the gene pool of the recipient population.\n\n3. **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium** assumes no gene flow, among other conditions. When gene flow occurs, it introduces new alleles to a population, disrupting the equilibrium because it's an addition of genetic diversity from external sources.\n\n4. **Speciation** is the process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. Gene flow can prevent speciation because it homogenizes genetic differences between populations. If populations are continually sharing alleles, it becomes harder for them to diverge genetically to form new species.\n\n5. **Genetic drift** is random changes in allele frequencies, more pronounced in small populations. Gene flow generally affects genetic drift by introducing new alleles, which can counteract the random loss of alleles.\n\n6. **Genetic diversity** typically increases with gene flow, as new alleles are introduced from other populations, countering local loss of diversity.\n\n7. The rate of **genetic diseases** or **deleterious mutations** is not directly dictated by gene flow; these rates are more influenced by mutation rates and selective pressures.\n\n8. **Genetic homogeneity** in a metapopulation can increase with gene flow, as differences between populations decrease and overall genetic similarity across the population increases.\n\n9. The rate of mutations, whether beneficial or deleterious, is a separate process from gene flow. Gene flow itself doesn't directly affect mutation rates but can affect the spread of new mutations.\n\nWith these points in mind, we can conclude that the correct answer pertains to increasing genetic homogeneity and decreasing the likelihood of speciation. Among the options:\n\n(A) Disruption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the metapopulation - This is true.\n(B) An increased likelihood of speciation - This is incorrect; it usually decreases speciation likelihood.\n(C) A decrease in the likelihood of speciation - This is correct.\n(D) An increased likelihood of genetic drift in the metapopulation - This is incorrect; it usually reduces the effect of drift.\n(E) A decrease in genetic diversity in the metapopulation - This is incorrect; it usually increases diversity.\n(F) An increase in the rate of genetic diseases in the metapopulation - This is not directly affected.\n(G) An increase in the rate of deleterious mutations in the metapopulation - This is not directly affected.\n(H) An increase in genetic homogeneity in the metapopulation - This is correct.\n(I) A decrease in the rate of beneficial mutations in the metapopulation - This is not directly affected.\n(J) Stabilization of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the metapopulation - This is incorrect; it disrupts equilibrium.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the best answers are (C) and (H). Given the request to choose one and repeat it five times:\n\nC is the most direct and simplest answer aligned with the provided options, so we will go with:\n\nCCCCCC", "response_B": "First, let's clearly understand what gene flow is and how it might affect populations.\n\n**Gene flow** refers to the transfer of genetic material (alleles) from one population to another within a species. This typically occurs when individuals from different populations migrate and reproduce, integrating their genetic material into the gene pool of the new population.\n\nHere\u2019s how gene flow impacts the various elements listed in the multiple-choice options:\n\n1. **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (options A and J):**\n   - Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a principle in population genetics where allele frequencies in a population remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of evolutionary influences. Gene flow introduces new alleles into a population or changes allele frequencies, thus disrupting Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\n2. **Speciation (options B and C):**\n   - Speciation is the process by which new species form. Gene flow between populations typically reduces differences between them by homogenizing allele frequencies. This generally decreases the likelihood of speciation because it reduces the genetic divergence necessary for species formation.\n\n3. **Genetic drift (option D):**\n   - Genetic drift is the change in allele frequencies due to random sampling. With increased gene flow, populations are more genetically similar and larger in effective size, thus reducing the impact of genetic drift.\n\n4. **Genetic diversity (options E and H):**\n   - Gene flow generally increases genetic diversity within a single population by introducing new alleles. Across the metapopulation, however, gene flow can lead to increased genetic homogeneity as populations become more genetically similar to one another.\n\n5. **Genetic diseases and mutations (options F, G, I):**\n   - Gene flow typically does not directly increase the rate of genetic diseases or mutations. It generally increases overall genetic variation, potentially reducing the effects of harmful alleles by promoting genetic diversity.\n\nConsidering these points, we need to focus on how gene flow:\n1. Disrupts Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (ruling out J),\n2. Decreases the likelihood of speciation (ruling out B),\n3. Decreases the impact of genetic drift (ruling out D),\n4. Increases genetic homogeneity across the metapopulation (suggesting H),\n5. Generally increases genetic diversity within populations (ruling out E),\n6. Does not notably affect the rates of mutations and diseases directly (ruling out F, G, I).\n\nCombining this understanding, the answer is most consistent with option **H**: \"an increase in genetic homogeneity in the metapopulation.\"\n\nTherefore, my best answer is HHHHH.", "label": "B>A"}

{"question": "In 1993, a rancher had good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094if anyone \u0080\u0094was using it.
